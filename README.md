# PubDev

An open platform for new web developers to try their hands at fullstack development in a free, sandboxed, batteries-included environment.

# Development

You should have a local running instance of the backend ([see here](https://github.com/JasonXu314/koyeb-server)). Set the `VITE_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` and `VITE_PUBLIC_VIEW_URL` to `http://pub-dev.localhost:5000` and `http://__NAME__.pub-dev.localhost:5000`, respectively.
